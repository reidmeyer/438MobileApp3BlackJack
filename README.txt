BlackJack App


On testing, the app works as intended. One small thing that might not be clear is that if the user changes the bet amount to an amount outside of the
allowed range, the bet will default to 0. One other small thing; we made it so there is a pause in between rounds. Each time you have to click start game. 
We decided this because of our creative portion. We talked to Professor Shook about this and he believed this would be the best implementation.


CREATIVE:

Made it so the user can bet. When someone creates an account, the user starts off with 1000 chips. The default value is 0 for bet amount in case they
want to practice. The UI displays the amount of chips, which is a field in the firebase database. The user can change the bet amount and then press 
start game. If the user changes the bet amount during a round, the new bet amount will take effect in the next round. Also, on the leaderboard, we 
made it so there is an option to sort by total wins or total chips earned.

We chose this feature because it is intuitive in blackjack. Poker players want to be able to bet.

We implemented it with an extra field in the firebase database. The user can input the bet into the field, and it is sanitized and checked so 
it doesn't break the system and is updated between games. Intially the player is not forced to bet every time and has the option of not betting as well.

The leader board as required displays wins when it is selected. However, we also give teh user the option to sort the leader board by chips as well as
it seemed most logical to let them see both wins and chips if we were going to track both in the database.
